# Genshin Impact Talent Book Farming

## Motivation

In the game Genshin Impact, in typical RPG fashion your characters get 'XP' and level up, getting stronger. They also have talents/skills which need to be levelled up but the only way to do that is to acquire 'talent books'. Each character has a certain talent book and those books can only be acquired on certain days of the week.

As I'm a super nerd who likes to keep spreadsheets for such ridiculous things that 'live service' games like to throw at us, I decided to make it easier on myself and make a site where I could just see which characters I could enhance that day.

(There are other sites which already solve this problem but hey, I wanted to make something myself, because I can.)

## Lessons Learned

This was the first 'side-project' I made after starting my course at [School Of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.com/), using vanilla JavaScript, which we learned in week 1.

I learned about using JS objects and how to add JS dynamically to the DOM.

The code is somewhat janky and it could do with some visual enhancements. I may change it but I also like how it reflects where I was at that time in my programming 'career'.
